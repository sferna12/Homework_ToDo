When you want to add, a dialog will display, prompting the user for the assignment name, the due date, and the class name.
It will add the assignment to the list, and the list will stay sorted by date. Closest date at the top, furtherst date at the bottom.

If you want to remove an item from the list, just long click the item and the item will be removed.
